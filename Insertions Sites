# It is in this path (cristobal) root@LAPTOP-KHQSUE4A:/home/Genes/9.3/gtf_fold#

## convert to universal coding. Becaus it was written in excel and change the extension to bed file
dos2unix insert_final.txt && mv insert_final.txt insert_final.bed

## It helps to put all of them in the same column
 awk '{ if ($2 < $3) print $1"\t"$2"\t"$3; else print $1"\t"$3"\t"$2 }' insert_final.bed > insert_final2.bed

## Run BedTools to identify genes associated to those insertion points
bedtools intersect -a genomic.gtf -b insert_final2.bed > filtered_output.gtf

### It extracts only column from gene_id
awk -F "\t" '{if ($3 == "gene") {match($9, /gene_id "([^"]+)"/, m); if (m[1] != "") print $1, m[1]}}' filtered_output.gtf > only_genes.txt

### This delete the LOCI, because are not considered in the Chiu results.
awk '!/LOC/' only_genes.txt > temp && mv temp only_genes.txt

awk '{print $2}' only_genes.txt > temp && mv temp only_genes.txt
